# NIBRS Explorer

Boston's [Mayor's 24-hour Constituent Service](http://www.cityofboston.gov/mayor/24/) allows Boston's citizens a way to engage with the City government to report and track issues that concern them.

The City of Boston and its [Department of Innovation and Technology](http://www.cityofboston.gov/DoIT/) are sponsoring a [http://hubhacks2.challengepost.com/](public hackathon) to develop data visualizations from the City's [open data portal](https://data.cityofboston.gov/).

This site, the Mayor's Hotline Explorer provides an interactive visualization of the public records concerning reported incidents.

### Development instructions

It should be sufficient to start from a clean checkout and issue:

    npm install
    bower install
    gulp

Serve the content locally out of the 'dist' directory.

When it comes time to publish to GitHub Pages, set the environment variables `SOCRATA_APP_TOKEN` and `GA_TRACKING_ID` to inject the correct info for the production instance and issue:

    gulp --env production deploy
